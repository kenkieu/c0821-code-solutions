//User can sign up.

Render method of the App component runs:
  If the isAuthorizing state is a falsy value
    AppContext is returned which includes PageContainer, which runs the renderPage method
    The renderPage method assigns the path property of the route object to const var path
        if path is the string sign-in, or sign up it returns React Element type Auth
        Auth component's render method destructures this.context.user, this.context.route, and this.context.handleSignIn, and assigns those to the const var user, route and handleSignIn
        Given the ternary expression route.path === 'sign in' is false, the string create an account is assigned to const var welcomeMessage
        The AuthPage is returned with all react elements and with react element AuthForm
         AuthForm component's render includes ternaries for if logging in or signing up and stores into variable
         Changes text to reflect a new user
         - welcomeMessage is Create an account...
         - alternateActionHref is Sign in Instead
         - submitButtonText is Register
      handleSubmit is called when the form submits and this.props.action (string sign up) is assigned to action
      fetch is called with the path of sign-in, and req is passed as the second argument to indicate POST and content type as JSON
        promise is returned from fetch, and then method is called on it which parses the body text as JSON
        then method is called on the return of the json method
          if the action is sign up then 'sign-in' is assgined to hash property of the location property of the window object
          this leads the user to the sign in page

//User can sign in.

    The renderPage method assigns the path property of the route object to const var path
      if path is the string sign-in, or sign up it returns React Element type Auth
      Given the ternary expression route.path === 'sign in' is true, the string please sign in to continue is assigned to const var welcomeMessage
      The AuthPage is returned with all react elements and with react element AuthForm
        AuthForm component's render includes ternaries for if logging in or signing up and stores into variable
          Changes text to reflect a new user
        - welcomeMessage is Please sign in...
        - alternateActionHref is Register Now
        - submitButtonText is Log In
      handleSubmit is called when the form submits and this.props.action (string sign in) is assigned to action
        fetch is called with the path of sign-in, and req is passed as the second argument to indicate POST and content type as JSON

        then method is called on the return of the json method
          if the action is sign in, a check for result.user and result.token takes place (both need to be truthy)
          the onSignIn method of the props object is called with the result of the userId, username, and token
           - onSignIn prop is passed from AppContext.Provider as part of the value, and AuthPage passes the prop to AuthForm
      handleChange is called onChange and detects the key inputs for username and password, and sets it as a state

//User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page).

  handleSignIn sets the token to localStorage so the user's information is saved
  User's id and username is also stored in app's state
  when the page is refreshed
  The hash is set inside the this.state.route
  The componentDidMount is called, and the token and user is pulled from localStorage, and isAuthorizing is set to false

//User can sign out.

In the nav component, the render method is called and it creates the button for sign out
The handleSignOut method from the app component is passed to the button react element, and set onClick
handleSignOut is called on click, and removes the token from local storage, and sets user to none in state
